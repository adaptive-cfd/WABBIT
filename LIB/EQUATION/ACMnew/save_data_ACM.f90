! save data. Since you might want to save derived data, such as the vorticity,
! the divergence etc., which are not in your state vector, this routine has to
! copy and compute what you want to save to the work array.

! In the main code, save_fields than saves the first N_fields_saved components of the
! work array to file.
!
! NOTE that as we have way more work arrays than actual state variables (typically
! for a RK4 that would be >= 4*dim), you can compute a lot of stuff, if you want to.
