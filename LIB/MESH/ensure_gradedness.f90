!> \brief check the gradedness after new refinement status
!
!> \details This routine is called after all blocks have been tagged whether to refine or coarsen or stay.
!! It now goes through the list of blocks and looks for refinement or coarsening states that would
!! result in an non-graded mesh. These mistakes are corrected, their status -1 or 0 is overwritten.
!! The status +1 is always conserved (recall to call respect_min_Jmax before).
!!
!!
!! Since 04/2017, the new code checks all blocks that want to coarsen or remain, NOT the ones that
!! want to refine, as was done in prototypes. The reason is MPI: I cannot easily set the flags of
!! my neighbors, as they might reside on another proc.
!!

!! = log ======================================================================================
!! \n
!! 10/11/16 - switch to v0.4 \n
!! 23/11/16 - rework complete subroutine: use list of active blocks, procs works now on light data \n
!! 03/02/17 - insert neighbor_num variable to use subroutine for 2D and 3D data \n
!! 05/04/17 - Improvement: Ensure a graded mesh in any case, not only in the coarsen states (which was done before)
!! 09/06/17 - speed up with switching to 8bit integer for working arrays, shorten send/receive buffer
