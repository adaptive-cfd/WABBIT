[Domain]
; 2D or 3D problem?
dim=2;
; box size of computational domain. [Lx Ly Lz]
domain_size=1 1;
; synchronization (on/off)on [x y z] domain boundaries
; (off (NON-PERIODIC): 0/false/yes | on (PERIODIC): 1/true/no)
periodic_BC=1 1;
; symmetry BC. If a problem has e.g, x symmetry (mirror axis is then the y-axis), you'd set 1 0 here.
; symmetry still goes with periodicity in the code: we solve a symmetric periodic problem (cosine-transform)
; this implies all BC in symmetric directions are treated symmetrically (so, at x=const=0 and x=const=Lx)
; While it is possible to also set dirichlet BC on either, we have not currently implemented it.
; Hint: ensure to not impose a meanflow in symmetric directions! Default: (.not. periodic_BC)
symmetry_BC=0 0;
; symmetry comes in two ways: for scalars (phi, pressure, density) and tangential velocity components (for
; y symmetry, this would be ux, uz but NOT uy), we simply mirror the data. For the normal component (here: uy)
; we mirror the component, invert the sign and also have to set uy=0 right on the line of symmetry.
; Tell the code what is a scalar and which are vector components. For 2D ACM this would be x y 0, for 3D ACM this would be x y z 0,
; for 3D compressible Navier_Stokes this would be 0 x y z 0 (0: scalar). The length of this vector equals number_equations. Default: 0 for all
symmetry_vector_component=


[Blocks]
; size of each block, must be odd (17, 19, 33, etc), if given one value this is used
; for all directions, or specify value for each direction
number_block_nodes=17 17;
; ghost nodes for each block. you need to know this value depending on the discretization and the multiresolution
; interpolation.
number_ghost_nodes=4;
; number of equations / components of state vector. Note you have to properly
; adjust this value for the physics module that you use.
; ACM: 3 (2D), 4 (3D)
; Convection: 1 (2D /3D)
number_equations=4;
; treelevel bounds: determine the highest (max_treelevel) and lowest (min_treelevel) refinement
; level of blocks. With each refinement level the grid gets refined by a factor of two. The maximum
; resolution at max_treelevel is dx = 2^-max_treelevel * L / Bs (L:domain size, Bs: blocksize)
max_treelevel=6;
; sometimes you want to restrict the minimum refinement as well, for example if we run equidistant
; simulations (which is quite rare!): in that case, max_treelevel = min_treelevel
min_treelevel=1;
; max number of trees in the forest. A tree corresponds to a grid; this notation
; only is important for postprocessing, i.e. using the adaptive-POD module. For running
; simulations, you can leave the value empty - it is set automatically.
max_forest_size=22;
; Use adaptivity or not? If adapt_mesh=1 then the grid is refined before a time step,
; the time evolution is done, and the grid is coarsened after the time step. If adapt_mesh=0
; the grid does not change after the initial condition, and refinement/coarsening are disabled.
adapt_mesh=1;
; adaptive initial conditon? i.e. create grid to respect error bounds
; default is same value as adapt_mesh
adapt_inicond=1;
; in some situations, it is necessary to create the intial grid, and then refine it for a couple of times.
; for example if one does non-adaptive non-equidistant spatial convergence tests. default is 0.
inicond_refinements=0;
; block distribution for balancing (also used for start distribution)
; [sfc_z | sfc_hilbert]
; sfc_z  -> space filling curve -> z-curve
; sfc_hilbert -> hilbert space filling curve
block_dist=sfc_hilbert;
; coarsening indicator to be used in mesh adaptation (=coarsening) [threshold-state-vector, random, primary-variables]
; threshold-state-vector: evaluates wavelet criterion on components of state vector. specify below which ones.
; primary-variables: only available for NStokes: converts statevector to (rho,u,v,w,p) before thresholding
; random: randomly coarse some blocks. used for testing. note we tag for coarsening only once in the first iteration
; everywhere: coarsenes the entire grid by one level. note that this is strictly speaking, only guranteed to be possible
; if the grid has been refined "everyhwere" before.
coarsening_indicator=threshold-state-vector;
; sometimes, it can be useful to use a different indicator to generate the initial grid. For example, we can generate
; some non-equidistant grid for inicond, then use coarsening_indicator=everywhere
; default: same as coarsening_indicator
coarsening_indicator_inicond=;
; use normalization for eps or not? Thresholding means we control the absolute error in some norm (often Linfty norm, see below)
; but very often, you rather want to control the relative error. So, some norm of the field is computed, such that
; || u-u_eps || / ||u|| < eps  (using the norm specified below)
; default=0, even though this is stupid: if you have large pressure (say u=1 and pressure=10000), then only the pressure will determine
; the grid
eps_normalized=1;
; WABBIT uses interpolating, biorthogonal wavelets. These wavelets are, by default, normalized in the Linfty
; norm. That means setting a threshold eps=1.0e-3, we guarantee that the error is < 1.0e-3 in Linfty norm.
; For denoising, we rather need to control the L2 error, because Donohos work is applicable only to the L2 norm.
; For CVS finally, which mimicks applying the denoising to vorticity, we need to control the H1 norm.
; [Linfty (default), L2, H1]
eps_norm=Linfty;
; threshold value for thresholding wavelet coefficients. smaller values imply denser grids. Typical values are ~1e-3
eps=1e-3;
; which components to use for coarsening_indicator? default is all components.
; active only if coarsening_indicator=threshold-state-vector. select the components, set as
; many as number_equations
threshold_state_vector_component=1 1 0;
; it can be useful to also use the mask function (if penalization is used) for grid adaptation.
; i.e. the grid is always at the finest level on mask interfaces. Careful though: the Penalization
; is implemented on physics-module level, i.e. it is not available for all modules.
threshold_mask=0;
; if this flag is set (1), then blocks on max level have to coarsen, even if their
; details are significant. This is equivalent to ensuring dealiasing. Hence, if set to 1,
; wabbit will evaluate the right hand side of your equation on max_treelevel, but in the mesh
; coarsening it will, regardless of the solution, downsample the result to max_treelevel-1. Your
; expected precision is thus max_treelevel-1, but the computational cost (derivatives and timestep)
; is on max_treelevel.
force_maxlevel_dealiasing=0;
; if desired, we perform more than one time step
; before adapting the grid again. this can further reduce the overhead of adaptivity
; Note: the non-linear terms can create finer scales than resolved on the grid. they
; are usually filtered by the coarsening/refinement round trip. So if you do more than one time step
; on the grid, consider using a filter. default is "1", which is the classical scheme
N_dt_per_grid=1;


[Time]
; final time to reach in simulation
time_max=1.0;
; maximum walltime allowed for simulations (in hours). The run will be stopped if this duration
; is exceeded. This is useful on real clusters, where the walltime of a job is limited, and the
; system kills the job regardless of whether we're done or not. If WABBIT itself ends execution,
; a backup is written and you can resume the simulation right where it stopped. Note you can also
; stop a run using the file "runtime_control" (set runtime_control=save_stop;)
walltime_max=999.9;
; While we can save every write_time time units of the simulation, it may be desirable to save also
; every couple of hours of runtime (for very expensive runs) so that we can be sure to be able to
; resume the simulation with at most the loss of these hours. default unused, set value in HOURS.

; the heat eqn, which is not implemented) may not even have a CFL restriction.
CFL=1.0;
; CFL critierum for penalization (dt<=CFL_eta*C_eta), if VPM is used. For RungeKuttaGeneric schemes, the constant
; has to be < 1.0 (otherwise the code is unstable). For krylov schemes, it can be greater

; wabbit can save the heavy data (flow fiels) to HDF5. What is saved depends on the physics modules

; written. The default is 0.0, so not used. NOTE: WABBIT still will adjust dt to precisely match
; the time for saving and statistics and the final time, if any of those is not a multiple of dt_fixed.
; In that case, some time steps may be smaller in order to reach those times.
dt_fixed=0.0;
; largest time step, if you want to set one. dt is always smaller than that, if the
; value is greater 0. default is 0.0, so not used. WABBIT overwrites the physics module dt

; you have to provide the values for the left side of the shock:
