[Domain]
; 2D or 3D problem?
dim=2;
; box size of computational domain. [Lx Ly Lz]
domain_size=1 1;
; synchronization (on/off)on [x y z] domain boundaries
; (off (NON-PERIODIC): 0/false/yes | on (PERIODIC): 1/true/no)
periodic_BC=1 1;


[Blocks]
; size of each block, must be odd (17, 19, 33, etc), if given one value this is used
; for all directions, or specify value for each direction
number_block_nodes=17 17;
; ghost nodes for each block. you need to know this value depending on the discretization and the multiresolution
; interpolation.
number_ghost_nodes=4;
; number of equations / components of state vector. Note you have to properly
; adjust this value for the physics module that you use.
; ACM: 3 (2D), 4 (3D)
; Convection: 1 (2D /3D)
number_equations=4;
; treelevel bounds: determine the highest (max_treelevel) and lowest (min_treelevel) refinement
; level of blocks. With each refinement level the grid gets refined by a factor of two. The maximum
; resolution at max_treelevel is dx = 2^-max_treelevel * L / Bs (L:domain size, Bs: blocksize)
max_treelevel=6;
; sometimes you want to restrict the minimum refinement as well, for example if we run equidistant
; simulations (which is quite rare!): in that case, max_treelevel = min_treelevel
min_treelevel=1;
; max number of trees in the forest. A tree corresponds to a grid; this notation
; only is important for postprocessing, i.e. using the adaptive-POD module. For running
; simulations, you can leave the value empty - it is set automatically.
max_forest_size=22;
; Use adaptivity or not? If adapt_mesh=1 then the grid is refined before a time step,
; the time evolution is done, and the grid is coarsened after the time step. If adapt_mesh=0
; the grid does not change after the initial condition, and refinement/coarsening are disabled.
adapt_mesh=1;
; adaptive initial conditon? i.e. create grid to respect error bounds
; default is same value as adapt_mesh
adapt_inicond=1;
; in some situations, it is necessary to create the intial grid, and then refine it for a couple of times.
; for example if one does non-adaptive non-equidistant spatial convergence tests. default is 0.
inicond_refinements=0;
; block distribution for balancing (also used for start distribution)
; [sfc_z | sfc_hilbert]
; sfc_z  -> space filling curve -> z-curve
; sfc_hilbert -> hilbert space filling curve
block_dist=sfc_hilbert;
; coarsening indicator to be used in mesh adaptation (=coarsening) [threshold-state-vector, random, primary-variables]
; threshold-state-vector: evaluates wavelet criterion on components of state vector. specify below which ones.
; primary-variables: only available for NStokes: converts statevector to (rho,u,v,w,p) before thresholding
; random: randomly coarse some blocks. used for testing. note we tag for coarsening only once in the first iteration
coarsening_indicator=threshold-state-vector;
; use normalization for eps or not? Thresholding means we control the absolute error in some norm (often Linfty norm, see below)
; but very often, you rather want to control the relative error. So, some norm of the field is computed, such that
; || u-u_eps || / ||u|| < eps  (using the norm specified below)
; default=0, even though this is stupid: if you have large pressure (say u=1 and pressure=10000), then only the pressure will determine
; the grid
eps_normalized=1;
; WABBIT uses interpolating, biorthogonal wavelets. These wavelets are, by default, normalized in the Linfty
; norm. That means setting a threshold eps=1.0e-3, we guarantee that the error is < 1.0e-3 in Linfty norm.
; For denoising, we rather need to control the L2 error, because Donohos work is applicable only to the L2 norm.
; For CVS finally, which mimicks applying the denoising to vorticity, we need to control the H1 norm.
; [Linfty (default), L2, H1]
eps_norm=Linfty;
; threshold value for thresholding wavelet coefficients. smaller values imply denser grids. Typical values are ~1e-3
eps=1e-3;
; which components to use for coarsening_indicator? default is all components.
; active only if coarsening_indicator=threshold-state-vector. select the components, set as
; many as number_equations
threshold_state_vector_component=1 1 0;
; it can be useful to also use the mask function (if penalization is used) for grid adaptation.
; i.e. the grid is always at the finest level on mask interfaces. Careful though: the Penalization
; is implemented on physics-module level, i.e. it is not available for all modules.
threshold_mask=0;
; if this flag is set (1), then blocks on max level have to coarsen, even if their
; details are significant. This is equivalent to ensuring dealiasing. Hence, if set to 1,
; wabbit will evaluate the right hand side of your equation on max_treelevel, but in the mesh
; coarsening it will, regardless of the solution, downsample the result to max_treelevel-1. Your
; expected precision is thus max_treelevel-1, but the computational cost (derivatives and timestep)
; is on max_treelevel.
force_maxlevel_dealiasing=0;
; if desired, we perform more than one time step
; before adapting the grid again. this can further reduce the overhead of adaptivity
; Note: the non-linear terms can create finer scales than resolved on the grid. they
; are usually filtered by the coarsening/refinement round trip. So if you do more than one time step
; on the grid, consider using a filter. default is "1", which is the classical scheme
N_dt_per_grid=1;


[Time]
; final time to reach in simulation
time_max=1.0;
; maximum walltime allowed for simulations (in hours). The run will be stopped if this duration
; is exceeded. This is useful on real clusters, where the walltime of a job is limited, and the
; system kills the job regardless of whether we're done or not. If WABBIT itself ends execution,
; a backup is written and you can resume the simulation right where it stopped. Note you can also
; stop a run using the file "runtime_control" (set runtime_control=save_stop;)
walltime_max=999.9;
; While we can save every write_time time units of the simulation, it may be desirable to save also
; every couple of hours of runtime (for very expensive runs) so that we can be sure to be able to
; resume the simulation with at most the loss of these hours. default unused, set value in HOURS.
walltime_write=;
; number of time steps performed. if not set, default value is very large
nt=;
; CFL criterium (velocity). Note the time step dt is dictated by the physics modules: some eqns (like
; the heat eqn, which is not implemented) may not even have a CFL restriction.
CFL=1.0;
; CFL critierum for penalization (dt<=CFL_eta*C_eta), if VPM is used. For RungeKuttaGeneric schemes, the constant
; has to be < 1.0 (otherwise the code is unstable). For krylov schemes, it can be greater
; 1, but be careful about the error. This parameter is used by ACM physics module only.
CFL_eta=0.99;
; time step restriction of viscous terms ( dt < CFL_NU * dx**2 / nu )
; runge kutta 4 has constraints: 2D=>0.14 3D=>0.094 (exact expression: 2.79/(dim*pi**2)), these are
; the default values
CFL_nu=;
; wabbit can save the heavy data (flow fiels) to HDF5. What is saved depends on the physics modules
; and the section [Saving]. Here you control WHEN you want to save the output: either after a fixed
; number of time steps [fixed_freq], or after a physical time interval [fixed_time]
write_method=fixed_time;
; if write_method=fixed_freq:
; write frequency for output, choose very large number for disabling output on disk
write_freq=2;
; if write_method=fixed_time:
; write time for output
write_time=100.05;
; fixed time step. if the value is greater 0.0, then the time step is fixed no matter what.
; the setting from the physics modules, which usually decide about dt, are ignored and over-
; written. The default is 0.0, so not used. NOTE: WABBIT still will adjust dt to precisely match
; the time for saving and statistics and the final time, if any of those is not a multiple of dt_fixed.
; In that case, some time steps may be smaller in order to reach those times.
dt_fixed=0.0;
; largest time step, if you want to set one. dt is always smaller than that, if the
; value is greater 0. default is 0.0, so not used. WABBIT overwrites the physics module dt
; by that value, if the timestep is larger than dt_max and dt_max > 0.
dt_max=0.0;
; time-step method. can be either "RungeKuttaGeneric" or "Krylov". In the former case,
; any explicit Runge-Kutta scheme can be set by using the Butcher-Tableau. (RK4 is default) In the latter,

; The usual RungeKuttaChebychev method contains a number of hard coded schemes for different
; number of stages "s" and the fixed damping coefficient eps=10.0 (see Verwer and Sommeijer)

[Saving]
; WABBIT is in charge of saving, but what is saved is controled by the physics modules.
; here, you need to tell WABBIT how many fields are saved and how they will be labeled.
; The physics modules are then in charge of providing the respective data to WABBIT. I.e.
; if the field is called "mask", WABBIT will ask the physics module to return the array
; "mask" and then save that to disk.

[Sponge]
; sponge term, used in ACM module to mimick outflow conditions for pressure waves
; NOTE (ACM): when the sponge is used, be sure to allow for mask_time_dependent_part=1. Even

; the sponge does not have to be at the maximum refinement level.
use_sponge=0;
; shape of the sponge. the tradional form (default) is "rect", but we have a smoothed

; that since we try to create the time-independent mask function only once, but the time-dependent
; part of course in every time step.
; NOTE: the flag threshold_mask has a critical impact here: if it is false, it is not guaranteed that the

; NOTE: Those parameters are used only in Nstokes and only if [Navier_Stokes]::case=simple_geometry
; + for implementation of the geometry we use the volume penalization method
; (see: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compfluid.2008.07.003, Boiron 2008)
;     - Ceta is read from [VPM]::Ceta
;     - make sure [VPM]::penalization=1;
;     - for the in and out-flow we use sponges which mimic dirichlet BC
;       all Spong parameter are read form [Sponge]

; what geometry is it?
geometry=triangle; [ cylinder | rhombus | triangle ]
; center coordinate of object
x_cntr=0.5 0.5 0;
; [triangle,rhombus]: angle between symmetry axis and triangle side (in degrees please)
angle=30;
; [triangle,rhombus,cylinder]: length or diameter of the object
length=0.3;
; + initial condition:
; availabel intial conditions are [mask | moving-shock | pressure-blob | zeros]
; the initial values are taken form [initial_values]
; + note: inicond mask sets u=u0 and rho=rho0 and p=p0 for the sponge reference values
; -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
; FREE OUTLET for shock geometries
; if free_outlet_wall is true a free outlet sponge will be added to
; the domain boundary perpendicular to the
; the inlet flow direction (x-direction)

[Shock_Tube]
; This section is only available for NStokes! It is used to validate
; the RHS euler equations and test the filter methods
; ------------------------------------------------------------------
; available shock configurations: [sod_shock_tube | moving-shock | standing-shock]
name=sod_shock_tube;
; + sod_shock_tube: see Publication Gary A Sod.,1987
; + moving-shock:   - is a shock front which moves with speed Mach_shock
;                   - the statevector left and right of the shock is computed
;                     from the Rankine-Hugoniot conditions
;                     (see F.Toro "Riemann solvers and numerical methods for fluid dynamics
;                     p. 98ff)
; + standing-shock: - is a standing shock wave
;-------------------------------------------------------------------
; for moving and standing shocks,
; you have to provide the values for the left side of the shock:
; the values of the right side are then computed from Rankine-Hugoniot conditions
pressure_left=101330.0;
velocity_left=50.0;
temperature_left=200;
density_left=1.645;
; and the speed of the shock wave for the moving shock
shock_wave_speed=500;
; normal vector of the shock front:
; the normal vectors are parallel to the Standard basis vectors
; choose 1 for the normal vector e_1 (x-direction)
;        2 for ...               e_2 (y-direction) etc.
